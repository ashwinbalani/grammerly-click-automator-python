Upload any document to Grammerly, and wait for corrections proposed by the website

Run the code using any Python editor (Tested on IDLE and Spyder)

And the code will automate all corrections in the document (while you are free to do whatever you need to, but not on the computer ofcourse!)

Hope this tool helps you
